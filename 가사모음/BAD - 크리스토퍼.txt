I don't wanna be another him, that shit is over
Finally, you found yourself a friend
And you run him over
Ever since the start
I saw the end around the corner
'Cause I know you so well
So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad, you know
So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad (uh)
My baby's bad, you know
My baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
